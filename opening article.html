    <p>
      Deep in the icy world of the south, Mama Penguin had one little chick named <span class="highlight">Pingu</span>. Pingu was bright, playful, and full of curiosity — but he <strong>hated studying math</strong>. 
      “Why count fish?” he’d say, “I just want to swim and slide!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Mama smiled, but inside she worried. “One day, numbers will save your life,” she whispered. Pingu only laughed and waddled away, chasing snowflakes instead of solving problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then came a stormy morning. The sea cracked open, and Pingu drifted far away on a piece of ice. The wind howled, and the path home split into <strong>seven icy bridges</strong>. Each bridge had a question carved into the ice — math questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Only those who can answer shall cross,” said a voice in the wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pingu trembled. He remembered Mama’s lessons, her voice teaching him to count, add, and think. With tears freezing on his feathers, he began to solve them one by one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The numbers lit up the bridges, melting the fear around him. Finally, as he solved the last question, the wind carried Mama’s soft voice:
      <br><em>“You see, my little one... even the smallest sum can light the darkest ice.”</em>
    </p>

    <div class="help-box">
      <strong>Help Mama Penguin and Pingu!</strong>
      <p>
        Will you help Pingu finish his journey? Use your math skills to guide him home — every correct answer brings him closer to his family!
